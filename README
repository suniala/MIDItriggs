MIDItriggs is a universal MIDI to/from trigger interface with powerful drivers
for the Roland CR-78 platform. The sources should enable you to port the
project to other host platforms or maybe invent totally new projects based on
this simple hard/software. MIDI controllers, MIDI filters, MIDI light switch
control, whatever you can imagine, all is possible based on this stuff :)
